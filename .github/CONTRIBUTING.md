## Contributing to pyvidplayer2

If you're looking for something to do, look for the `help wanted` tag in the [issues page](https://github.com/anrayliu/pyvidplayer2/issues).

If you want to contribute something that's not there, open a feature request issue and we can discuss.

## Before creating a pull request

- [ ] Is the [documentation](https://github.com/anrayliu/pyvidplayer2/blob/main/documentation.md) updated? 
- [ ] If it's a new feature, has an [example](https://github.com/anrayliu/pyvidplayer2/tree/main/examples) been added?
- [ ] Do *most* of the [unit tests](https://github.com/anrayliu/pyvidplayer2/blob/main/tests/readme.txt) pass? Some can be inconsistent, so if there's a comment about that, it shouldn't be a big deal.

Every bit helps!
